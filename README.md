Efficient LLM fine-tuning on small VRAM (IN DEVELOPMENT!)
</h3>

peftee (PEFT-ee) is a lightweight Python library for large-context LLM inference, built on top of Huggingface Transformers and PyTorch.   No quantization is used—only fp16/bf16 precision. 

Since most real-world “fine-tuning” is actually output-style alignment, you don’t need to change deep model representations — just the top reasoning layers and output heads.
Hence:
✅ Better to apply LoRA to only the last 4–8 transformer blocks in BF16 precision
than to quantize everything and LoRA all layers.

It trains faster, is more stable, and directly affects the linguistic output behavior without disturbing factual embeddings.

⚡ 4. Combined best practice

Hybrid strategy for production systems:

Frozen base model (factual memory).

LoRA (last layers) → behavioral/style alignment.

RAG or toolformer layer → external factual grounding.

Optionally: function calling or structured decoding for task reliability.

This combination (LoRA + RAG) is what’s behind most modern pipelines like Claude 3’s retrieval, GPTs with memory, and Gemini 1.5.

<small>By "Baseline" we mean typical inference without any offloading</small>

How do we achieve this:

- Loading layer weights from SSD directly to GPU one by one
- Offloading KV cache to SSD and loading back directly to GPU, no quantization or PagedAttention
- Offloading layer weights to CPU if needed
- FlashAttention-2 with online softmax. Full attention matrix is never materialized. 
- Chunked MLP. Intermediate upper projection layers may get large, so we chunk MLP as well 
---
Typical use cases include:
- Analyze contracts, regulations, and compliance reports in one pass
- Summarize or extract insights from massive patient histories or medical literature
- Process very large log files or threat reports locally
- Analyze historical chats to extract the most common issues/questions users have
---
**Supported GPUs**: NVIDIA (with additional performance benefits from `kvikio` and `flash-attn`), AMD, and Apple Silicon (MacBook).



## Getting Started

It is recommended to create venv or conda environment first
```bash
python3 -m venv ollm_env
source ollm_env/bin/activate
```

Install oLLM with `pip install --no-build-isolation ollm` or [from source](https://github.com/Mega4alik/ollm):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mega4alik/ollm.git
cd ollm
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .

# for Nvidia GPUs with cuda (optional): 
pip install kvikio-cu{cuda_version} Ex, kvikio-cu12 #speeds up the inference
```
> 💡 **Note**  
> **voxtral-small-24B** requires additional pip dependencies to be installed as `pip install "mistral-common[audio]"` and `pip install librosa`
